A given model, or indeed an application, will often have some parameters associated with
it.
While any standard Ruby accessors and instance variables can be used to define such
parameters the following API is provided to define them in a standardized way. The 
advantages to using this API vs. a roll-your-own solution are as follows:

* The API provides a number of features that go above and beyond what basic Ruby
  attribute accessors provide, this would require significant application-side code to
  replicate
* Using standard APIs gives your code a familiar look and feel to any new developers who
  may work on it in future
* You will be able to benefit from future additions to the Origen ecosystem that hook into
  this API, e.g. a documentation helper to automatically generate a parameter summary
  will almost certainly emerge

#### Basic Idea

Parameters are defined as a group of named values that will apply in a given context, many
different sets of values to apply in different contexts can be defined.
A context can be used to represent any abstract concept that you like, but a good example 
would be to have a set of parameter values that will apply at probe, a different set for final test and a
different set for spec operation.

The current parameter context can be set and changed dynamically at runtime as required
by your application, typically this would be set on a per-target/environment basis or for pattern
generation on a per-pattern basis.
A common approach for pattern generation is to leverage [sourceless pattern generation](<%= path "guides/pattern/name" %>)
and employ the convention that the first field in the pattern name refers to the spec
context - e.g. probe_mypat, ft_mypat, spec_mypat.
It is then trivial to set the parameter context based on the pattern name, thereby providing a bulletproof way to update any
given parameter for every probe pattern by simply updating its value in the probe parameter
set definition.

#### Including the Parameters API

To use the parameters API in an abstract class the following module can be included:

~~~ruby
include Origen::Parameters
~~~

However this is already included the <code>Origen::Model</code> and <code>Origen::TopLevel</code>
modules and any class which includes those will already have access to this API.

#### Defining a Set of Parameters

Parameters are defined as shown below, it is always a good idea to create a parameter
context called <code>:default</code>, these are the values that will be enabled when
a parameter context has not explicitly been set:

~~~ruby
define_params :default do |params|
  params.tprog = 20.uS
  params.terase = 100.mS
end
~~~

Parameters can be organized into namespaces by simply writing them, no upfront definition
is required and there is no limit to how deeply nested they can be:

~~~ruby
define_params :default do |params|
  params.program.time = 20.uS
  params.erase.time = 100.mS
  params.erase.pulse_count = 10
  params.test.dc.vdd.min = 1.5
  params.test.dc.vdd.max = 2.5
end
~~~

Parameters are read back in application code via the <code>params</code> method:

~~~ruby
params.test.dc.vdd.min   # => 1.5
~~~

Each namespace in the chain returns an object that can be used like a hash:

~~~ruby
def print_erase_parameters
  params.erase.each do |name, value|
    puts "#{name}: #{value}"
  end
end

print_erase_parameters   # => time: 0.1 
                         # => pulse_count: 10
~~~

The current parameter context is set as follows:

~~~ruby
params.context        # => :default
params = :probe
params.context        # => :probe
with_params :ft do
  params.context      # => :ft
end
params.context        # => :probe
~~~

#### Tracking the Context of Another Object

The parameter context for a given object can be configured to automatically track that of another object by
specifying a Ruby path to the object to be tracked as shown below:

~~~ruby
# A short hand is available to track the parameter context from the top level ($dut)
class MyObject
  include Origen::Model
  parameters_context :top
end

# Or you can supply a path to the object in the form of a string, here the path reference is local to the MyObject
# instance
class MyObject
  include Origen::Model
  parameters_context 'parent.mbist'
end

# Or another example where the target object is found via the global scope
class MyObject
  include Origen::Model
  parameters_context '$dut.pll'
end
~~~

Then whenever the parameter context is set on the tracked object the same context name will be applied
when referencing a parameter within the tracking object, for example:

~~~ruby
$dut.params.context           # => :default
my_object.params.context      # => :default
$dut.params.context = :probe
$dut.params.context           # => :probe
my_object.params.context      # => :probe
~~~

#### Late Defined Parameters

Occasionally the need may arise to base a parameter value on a property of the model
or the wider environment that is not yet finalized or known at the time when the parameter
definition code is being executed.
In that case the parameter can be defined as a function and Origen will hold off evaluating
it until the last possible moment when it is first referenced:

~~~ruby
define_params :default do  |params|
  params.test.dc.vdd.min = -> { $dut.vdd * 0.9 }
end
~~~

Such parameters will behave identically to standard parameters in all respects and consumers
will not be able to tell if a given parameter originated from a function.

#### Defining Child Sets

Complete parameter sets can be defined for different named contexts, however in many cases
only a subset of the parameters will have different values vs. another context.
To make maintenance of such cases efficient the API allows parameter sets to be defined in a
hierarchy such that a given set can be defined with a parent and if it does not define
a value for a given parameter then the value from the parent will be returned instead.

Parameter sets can inherit from within the same object scope or from another DUT object
entirely.  Local inheritance passes the name of another parameter set as a Symbol.  To
inherit from another object a String must be passed that starts with 'dut' or 'top, and 
is delimited by periods.  Here is how the string argument is parsed:

~~~ruby
str_arg = 'dut.ddr.default'
arg_array = str_arg.split('.')
['dut',top'].include?(arg_array[0]).should == true
dut_path_to_object = arg_array[1..-2]    # => 'ddr'
parameter_context = arg_array[-1].to_sym # => :default
~~~

##### Local Inheritance

~~~ruby
define_params :ate, inherit: :default do |params|
  params.erase.time = 40.mS
end

define_params :probe, inherit: :ate do |params|
  params.erase.time = 20.mS
  params.erase.pulse_count = 5
end

define_params :ft, inherit: :ate do |params|
  params.erase.pulse_count = 7
end

with_params :probe do
  params.program.time        # => 20uS (inherited from :default)
  params.erase.time          # => 20ms
  params.erase.pulse_count   # => 5
end

with_params :ft do
  params.program.time        # => 20uS (inherited from :default)
  params.erase.time          # => 40ms (inherited from :ate)
  params.erase.pulse_count   # => 7
end
~~~

##### Remote Inheritance

~~~ruby
define_params :ate, inherit: 'dut.ddr.default' do |params|
  params.erase.time = 40.mS
end
~~~

Sometimes the parameter definition for a child context should be a function of the
value from the parent, when defining a child context the parent can be accessed
like this:

~~~ruby
define_params :ate, inherit: :default do |params, parent|
  params.test.dc.vdd.min = parent.test.dc.vdd.min * 0.9
  params.test.dc.vdd.max = parent.test.dc.vdd.max * 1.1
end

params.context            # => :default
params.test.dc.vdd.min    # => 1.5
params.test.dc.vdd.max    # => 2.5
params = :ate
params.test.dc.vdd.min    # => 1.35
params.test.dc.vdd.max    # => 2.75
~~~

The context can also be explicitly supplied when fetching a parameter, this will
override the parameter context that would otherwise be applied:

~~~ruby
params.context                  # => :default
params.test.dc.vdd.min          # => 1.5
params(:ate).test.dc.vdd.min    # => 1.35
~~~

#### Live Updating Parameters

When a parameter is referenced a static value is returned which thereafter has no
relationship to the current parameter context, for example:

~~~ruby
terase = params.erase.time
params.erase.time                # => 100ms
terase                           # => 100ms
params = :probe                 
params.erase.time                # => 20ms
terase                           # => 100ms
~~~

The above should not be surprising and is what would normally be expected, however
through the magic of Ruby a live updating parameter can be returned by referring
to it via <code>params.live</code>:

~~~ruby
terase = params.live.erase.time
terase                           # => 100ms
params = :probe               
terase                           # => 20ms
~~~

This is an experimental feature and developers are encouraged to play around with it and
report back on any useful applications that they may find for it.
Potentially this is a good way to expose parameters via an interface to 3rd parties without coupling
them tightly to the namespacing and organization of the parameters within the owning class.

It is certainly only really useful when applied in conjunction with parameter contexts that can
change within the scope of a pattern or other Origen thread of execution. While the examples
so far have focussed on parameter contexts that will be permanent for a given thread,
like probe or ft, contexts can be used to represent more dynamic concepts. For example a given
NVM pattern may read the flash under different read conditions where the configuration for
each one is modelled by parameter contexts defined within the read controller.

Another possible use case is to bind register bit values to parameters, due to the way
that Origen stores register data at bit level a register cannot simply be written to a live
parameter, however a dedicated API is provided for this case:

~~~ruby
reg :erase, 0x0 do
  bits 3..0, :pulses
end

erase.pulses.data    # => 0
erase.pulses.bind params.live.erase.pulse_count
erase.pulses.data    # => 10
params = :probe
erase.pulses.data    # => 5
~~~

In other words anytime that register gets written in the course of a pattern generation
run its value will automatically track the current parameter context.
